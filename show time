Bar Chart: Top Genres

This chart will visually represent the query that identified the most popular genres.
On the X-axis, list the genres.
On the Y-axis, represent the number of shows for each genre (use the number_of_shows column from your query result).
Use bar heights to depict the relative popularity of each genre (higher bar = more shows).
Pie Chart: Distribution by Country (Optional - If your data includes country information):

This chart will show the distribution of shows across different countries.
Each slice of the pie represents a country.
The size of the slice corresponds to the number of shows produced by that country (use the number_of_shows column from your query result).
If your data doesn't have a "country" column, you can skip this chart or create another one based on a different finding.
Bar Chart (or Line Chart): Average Seasons per Release Year (Optional):

This chart (optional) can explore how the average number of seasons per show varies across release years.
On the X-axis, represent the release years of the shows.
On the Y-axis, represent the average number of seasons for shows released in that year (you might need to calculate this using a pivot table or helper functions in Excel).
A bar chart shows the average seasons for each year, while a line chart can indicate any trends over time.
